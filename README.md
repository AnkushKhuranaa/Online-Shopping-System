# Online-Shopping-System

Customers need to be physically present at shopping centres for buying, returning or exchanging clothes and have to wait in long queues. With a busy lifestyle, it is hard to do so.

An ecommerce website is the solution to this problem. This website can be used to order clothes online and hosts all required goods/products. The proposed system helps in building a website to buy clothes online using internet. By purchasing clothes online, user can choose different products based on categories , online payments , delivery services and hence covering the disadvantages of the existing system and making the buying easier and helping the vendor to reach wider market.

Advantages of the new system proposed:

Choose products faster and easier at one place.
Saves time of travelling to the vendor/sellerâ€™s place.
Good/Trusted & stress free delivery services. Products bought online will be delivered to the footsteps of the buyer.
