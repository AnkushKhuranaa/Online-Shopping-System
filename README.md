# Online-Shopping-System

Problem Statement: 

In existing system there are few problems: 

For buying clothes, customers have to visit the shops physically and travel to the shop’s destination.
Customers have to wait in long queues for billing of the item.
For exchange and returns also they have to do the same thing again.



PROPOSED SOFTWARE

In day to day life, we will need to buy lots of goods or products from a shop. Now a days, it is really hard to get some time to go out and get them by ourselves due to busy life style or lots of works. In order to solve this, we are making this ecommerce website. Using these website, we can buy clothes online just by visiting the website and ordering the item online by making payments online.
One place where we can get all required goods/products online. The proposed system helps in building a website to buy clothes online using internet connection. Purchasing of clothes online, user can choose different products based on categories , online payments , delivery services and hence covering the disadvantages of the existing system and making the buying easier and helping the vendor to reach wider market.
Advantages of the new system proposed 
Choose products faster and easier at one place.
Saves time of travelling to the vendor/seller’s place.
Good/Trusted & Tension free delivery services. Products bought online will be delivered to the footsteps of the buyer.
